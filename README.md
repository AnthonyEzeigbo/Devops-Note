# Devops-Note

Giving this scenero, you thought about a great idea on how to solve the problem of traditional way of food ordering in a busy aiport, instead of the long lines and slow process of ordering your food, you came up with an idea of solving the frontline problem and reducing the long line by building an app to place your other and you get notified once its ready instead of standing in long cue.

you will have to ask your self what steps to take to be able to achieve your goal.

there is a number of things that goes into building an App, you have to write the code,you have to host it and make sure the public can have access to it,it has to be scalable to meet up the demand and etc, we have start with the development environment first.

*<ins>Development Environment</ins>*

You need a development environment when building out an application, your laptop or desktop can serve as your `Dev` environment and the you can chose whatever programming language you would like to use, every app has to be written in a programming language.

Lets assume that we are building our app on our laptop as our ` Dev Environment` using python as our programming language of choice, once we are doing building it has to be hosted on our `local host 8080`, where it is accessable to the public but once we shortdown our laptop the app cant be reachable, so we need to host our app on a system that is never turnd off, so what do we do we get a dedicated server for that and that where your production environment comes in.
